### Hi there! <img src="https://emojis.slackmojis.com/emojis/images/1536351075/4594/blob-wave.gif" width="25"/>

I'm **Aditya Mogal**, a software developer.

I love building clean, reliable, and meaningful software. I’m especially interested in how real-world products work behind the scenes — from smooth user experiences to well-structured systems that scale. I enjoy turning ideas into functional, polished applications and improving the way people interact with technology.

Outside of development, I like exploring new technologies, learning about how things work, and constantly sharpening my understanding of software and product design. I enjoy reading, experimenting with side ideas, and staying curious about the world of engineering.
